# Sales Analysis Project — SQL & Power BI

## 📘 About the Project
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis on a simulated sales dataset using SQL for data preparation and Power BI for dashboard development. The goal was to extract insights for key business questions such as sales trends, top-performing products, customer segmentation, and target achievements. I handled all steps including requirement gathering, data modeling, query writing, and visual reporting.

## 🧩 Key Features
- Designed and built a relational data model for sales analytics.
- Used SQL to clean, join, and transform raw data tables.
- Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard showing KPIs, sales performance, and trends.
- Integrated budget and actual sales data to evaluate goal achievement.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- SQL Server (for querying and transformation)
- Power BI Desktop (for data visualization)
- Excel (for budget data and quick lookups)

## 📝 Business Needs
- Focus on **internet sales reports** with interactive filtering.
- Track **sold products**, **which clients** bought them, and **sales performance over time**.
- Allow filtering by **salesperson**, **product**, **customer**, and **time period**.
- Include a **budget comparison** for 2025 (delivered in EXCEL) and **look back 2 years** for historical analysis.
